// Now I need to "Add the code needed to serve the right pafe according to the url"

// I don't understand this instruction^^^ Soo starting the lesson back a few steps


// Here's where we're at. Starting with step 1 in getting started: 
// We've installed node. 
// We can run node by running the terminal command: 
// node index.js

// ^^ Doing this tells the shell(?) to run our script with node. 

// We'll also embed this information with a "shebang" line at the top of the file
// This line explicitly gives the absolute path of the interpreter. 
// Not all operating systems have node in the bin folder, but all should have env. So we use env node
// 


console.log('Hello World');
